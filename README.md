# Database Systems and Data Preparation
### Code sharing for Northwestern MS in Data Science program<br>
### MSDS 420 (Spring 2020)

The portfolio of projects in this repository cover the following:

* A1: Data Analysis with SQLalchemy
* A2: SQL and geospatial queries for data retrieval (Chicago Crime data set and Police Stations data set)
* A3: Data cleaning
* A4: NoSQL queries and output analysis (Chicago food safety inspections data set)

**Course overview**<br>
In this course students explore the fundamental concepts of database management and data preparation. With a focus on applications in large-scale data analytics projects, the course introduces relational database systems, the relational model, normalization process, and structured query language (SQL). The course discusses topics related to data integration and cleaning, database programming for extract, transform, and load (ETL) operations. Students learn NoSQL technologies for working with unstructured data and document-oriented information retrieval systems. They learn how to index and score documents for effective and relevant responses to user queries. Students acquire hands-on programming experience for data preparation and data extraction using various data sources and file formats.

Learning outcomes include the ability to:

* Define key terms, concepts, and issues in data preparation and database management systems  
* Discuss the architectures and technologies for relational database systems, data warehousing, information retrieval, and search engines
* Discuss the fundamental concepts of data storage, retrieval, analysis, and data processing for data analytics applications
* Apply the normalization process to analyze, design, and create relational database applications
* Explain the concepts of indexing and relevance in information retrieval/search engines
* Use a high-level programming language for data extraction, preparation and exploration
* Compare and contrast SQL database and NoSQL database systems and demonstrate the ability to interact with SQL and NOSQL databases
* Construct indexes for information retrieval
* Store and retrieve geospatial data and plot data on interactive maps
